# AR Pricefeed

Nothing too fancy, just a simple menubar app to keep an eye on the price of $AR

Supports MacOS 11 Big Sur and above

## Installation

- Download the zip from the latest [release](https://github.com/ankushKun/ar-pricefeed/releases)
- Unzip the zip
- Move ar-pricefeed.app to Applications folder
- Open the AR Pricefeed app from Applications
- BOOM! Live AR price in the menubar!

NOTE: If the app fails to launch, open finder, go into applications and right-click open the application, hopefully it will work lol üêò

The packaged app has been notarised by Apple and there should not be an issue running it
